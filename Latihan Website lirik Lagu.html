     I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true<br>
     Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you<br>
     This is typical of love<br>
     Can't wait anymore, I won't wait<br>
     I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever<br>
     In my dreams you're with me<br>
     We'll be everything I want us to be<br>
     And from there, who knows?<br>
     Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time<br>
     Or is that just me and my imagination?<br>
